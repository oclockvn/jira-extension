# Development Log

## Initial Setup - Chrome V3 Extension

### Created the following files:

1. **manifest.json**
   - Set up with Manifest V3 configuration
   - Defined basic extension properties
   - Removed image references as per user request

2. **popup.html**
   - Created a basic HTML structure for the extension popup
   - Linked to popup.css for styling and popup.js for functionality

3. **popup.css**
   - Added basic styling for the popup interface
   - Set up container, typography, and spacing

4. **popup.js**
   - Added a simple event listener for DOM content loaded
   - Prepared structure for additional functionality

5. **background.js**
   - Created a service worker script
   - Added installation and update event listeners
   - Set up logging for debugging

6. **README.md**
   - Documented the extension structure
   - Added installation instructions
   - Included development notes

### Design Decisions:
- Created a minimal but complete extension structure
- Followed Chrome's Manifest V3 requirements
- Omitted image files as requested
- Kept the code simple and well-commented for easy customization

## Added Utility Functions

### Created util.js:
- Added `toSnakeCase()` function to convert strings to snake-case format
- Function handles:
  - Converting text to lowercase
  - Replacing spaces with hyphens
  - Removing non-word characters
  - Cleaning up extra hyphens
- Added JSDoc documentation with example usage
- Exported the function for reuse in other files

## Added Content Script

### Created content.js:
- Added a content script that runs on all web pages
- Implemented page DOM manipulation capabilities
- Copied the `toSnakeCase()` utility function directly into the content script
  - This avoids ES module import issues in content scripts
- Added example functionality:
  - Converts page title to snake case
  - Creates a notification element (commented out by default)
- Set the script to run when the page DOM is fully loaded
- Updated manifest.json to register the content script
