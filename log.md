   - Set up with Manifest V3 configuration
   - Defined basic extension properties
   - Removed image references as per user request

2. **popup.html**
   - Created a basic HTML structure for the extension popup
   - Linked to popup.css for styling and popup.js for functionality

3. **popup.css**

   - Added installation and update event listeners
   - Set up logging for debugging

6. **README.md**
   - Documented the extension structure
   - Added installation instructions
   - Included development notes

### Design Decisions:
- Created a minimal but complete extension structure
- Followed Chrome's Manifest V3 requirements
- Omitted image files as requested
- Kept the code simple and well-commented for easy customization

## Added Utility Functions

### Created util.js:
- Added `toSnakeCase()` function to convert strings to snake-case format
- Function handles:
  - Converting text to lowercase
  - Replacing spaces with hyphens
  - Removing non-word characters
  - Cleaning up extra hyphens
- Added JSDoc documentation with example usage
- Exported the function for reuse in other files

## Added Content Script

### Created content.js:
- Added a content script that runs on all web pages
- Implemented page DOM manipulation capabilities
- Copied the `toSnakeCase()` utility function directly into the content script
  - This avoids ES module import issues in content scripts
- Added example functionality:
  - Converts page title to snake case
  - Creates a notification element (commented out by default)
- Set the script to run when the page DOM is fully loaded
- Updated manifest.json to register the content script

## Enhanced Jira Ticket Copy Functionality

### Updated manifest.json:
- Added required permissions:
  - `activeTab`: To access the current tab's content
  - `clipboardWrite`: To write to the clipboard
- Added host permissions for Atlassian domains
- Set content script to run at `document_idle` for optimal performance

### Enhanced content.js:
- Specialized the content script for Jira ticket pages
- Added ticket number extraction functionality:
  - Primary method: Extract from breadcrumb element
  - Fallback method: Extract from URL path
- Improved copy button UI:
  - Added Atlassian-style styling
  - Added hover effects
  - Added success/error feedback states
- Implemented clipboard functionality:
  - Copy ticket number to clipboard
  - Show visual feedback on success/failure
- Added MutationObserver to handle SPA navigation:
  - Detects DOM changes when navigating between tickets
  - Re-adds the copy button when needed
- Improved initialization logic:
  - Handles both loading and already-loaded DOM states

## Enhanced Copy Format to Include Ticket Title

### Updated content.js:
- Added functionality to copy both ticket number and title
- Created new helper functions:
  - `getTicketInfo()`: Retrieves both ticket number and title using DOM selectors
  - `formatTicketInfo()`: Formats the data in the pattern `[ticket-number] title`
- Updated the copy button click handler to:
  - Get both ticket number and title
  - Format them according to the specified pattern
  - Copy the formatted text to clipboard
- Added better error handling for cases where title or ticket number might be missing
- Improved logging for debugging purposes

## Refactored Button Styling to CSS

### Created content.css:
- Extracted all button styles from content.js into a dedicated CSS file
- Created styles for different button states:
  - Default state
  - Hover state
  - Success state (when copying is successful)
  - Error state (when copying fails)
- Added smooth transition effect for state changes

### Updated manifest.json:
- Added content.css to the content_scripts section
- Configured it to be injected alongside content.js

### Refactored content.js:
- Removed all inline styles from the button creation
- Replaced style manipulation with CSS class toggling:
  - Added 'success' class for successful copy operations
  - Added 'error' class for failed copy operations
- Simplified the code by leveraging CSS for styling concerns
- Improved separation of concerns (JS for behavior, CSS for presentation)

## Added Branch Name Copy Functionality and Improved CSS Structure

### Enhanced content.js:
- Added a second button for copying branch names
- Implemented `addCopyBranchButton()` function to:
  - Create a "COPY BRANCH" button
  - Format ticket info as a Git branch name using the `toSnakeCase()` function
  - Add proper prefix ('feature/') to branch names
- Updated the MutationObserver to handle both buttons

### Improved CSS Structure:
- Refactored CSS to use a common base class (`qp-button`) for shared styles
- Maintained specific classes for each button type:
  - `qp-copy-ticket-button` for the ticket copy button
  - `qp-copy-branch-button` for the branch name copy button
- Implemented a more maintainable CSS structure:
  - Common styles defined once
  - Button-specific styles for customization
  - Adjusted spacing between buttons for better visual appearance

## Refactored Button Creation Methods

### Improved content.js:
- Created a generic button creation function `addCopyButtonGeneric()` that:
  - Takes a configuration object with button text, class, and formatting function
  - Handles all the common functionality (DOM checks, button creation, event handling)
  - Manages clipboard operations and feedback states
- Refactored `addCopyButton()` and `addCopyBranchButton()` to use the generic function:
  - Each function now only provides its specific configuration
  - Reduced code duplication by ~50 lines
  - Maintained identical functionality and behavior
- Added JSDoc documentation for the new generic function
- Improved maintainability for future button additions
